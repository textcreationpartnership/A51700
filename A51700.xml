            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe publiſhing a Book to prove the <hi>Exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of a Deity</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt People that have all Inrolled themſelves <hi>Chriſtians</hi> at the Font, may poſſibly be thought unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; but it muſt be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch as are ſtrangers to this unhappy Age of ours,
<pb facs="tcp:58678:4"/>where it is eſteem'd by too many a piece of <hi>wit to be Prophane,</hi> and all things <hi>ſacred</hi> have been made ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Scoff &amp; Drollery; wherein <hi>Atheiſts</hi> have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared broad-faced, and with a prodigious impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence defied Heaven in the ſight of the Sun, underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to diſpute <hi>Divinity</hi> out of the World by <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> and levying Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt that Power which gave them Being;
<pb facs="tcp:58678:4"/>how requiſite then it is now to ſhew the abuſed World, that theſe <hi>Godleſs ones</hi> have all this while committed a Rape on their own <hi>Reaſon,</hi> who freely of her ſelf (would they but hear her ſpeak) leads them directly to the knowledge of a <hi>Deity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is it only theſe <hi>open Ranters</hi> that we are to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, there is a ſort of <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret demure Atheiſts,</hi> who verbally acknowledge a Deity, and perhaps make
<pb facs="tcp:58678:5"/>the moſt zealous pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Religion too, but Hearts being not really poſſeſt with a firm belief and ſtable apprehenſion of a <hi>moſt Juſt and Holy Power, that being ever preſent takes an Account of, and will one day ſeverely judge all their Actions,</hi> They thereupon give no other Check to their exorbitant Luſts, than what external or politick reſpects may Bridle them in with, whence proceeds
<pb facs="tcp:58678:5"/>that Innundation of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs that at this day o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verwhelms the World, and though theſe laſt may hypocritically Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit a veneration of the <hi>holy Scriptures,</hi> there is only this difference between them and the other Crew; that whereas the others diſclaim all regard to thoſe <hi>ſacred Oracles;</hi> theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to believe them, but really do not.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:58678:6"/>
            <p>To meet with them both, we recommend this brief <hi>Treatiſe</hi> to publick view, which not with <hi>flouriſhes of Rhetorick,</hi> or muſtering up <hi>Authorities, Fathers, Philoſophers,</hi> &amp;c.

<pb facs="tcp:58678:6"/>much ſtop the Torrent of Impiety in Mens Lives, and prepare them for the reception of, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to other Articles of the <hi>Chriſtian Faith</hi> and <hi>Goſpel Duties;</hi> The main part of it is an Arrow bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from the great <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinus</hi> his quiver; He that was lately Royal Profeſſor of <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> when he firſt ſent it abroad in its Roman Dreſs 'twas wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed with the applauſes

            <p>What entertainment it may meet with in this courſer Engliſh Garb, I cannot Divine, yet dare venture to ſay, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall Seriouſly and Underſtandingly read it over, cannot but confeſs a Deity, or diſown his

            <head>THE PREFACE OR INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>HOW ſpreading and Epidemical the Contagion of Atheiſm is grown of late, there are few ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py as to be ignorant, That
<pb facs="tcp:58678:9"/>the ſame not only ſtrikes at the Root of all Religion, but takes away all ſenſe of Good and Evil, all Truſt and Obligations amongſt Men; and conſequently is moſt deſtructive to humane Society and Government, is no leſs evident: To put ſome ſtop to this fatal Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent which thus threatens all things ſacred and civil with a Deluge, not a few have attempted with endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours no leſs laudable than
<pb facs="tcp:58678:9"/>laborious: Yet ſcarce at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining that ſucceſs as was wiſhed, by reaſon of their not proceeding in ſuch a Method of Proof, as the Adverſaries (who muſt be allowed to chooſe their Weapons, or they will never acknowledge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves vanquiſhed) have thought fit to expect for their Conviction; The authority of ſacred Scri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ptures, which pious Souls devoutly reverence, They
<pb facs="tcp:58678:10"/>Impudently deny; The ſenſe all Nations have of a Deity, they alledge is only a general cheat, and a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy Fancy blown into credulous heads by ſubtile Polititions. The Beauty and Harmony of the world they'l tell you, is only cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the curious motion of Dancing Atoms, or the apt, yet fortuitous concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Actives with Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſives: In brief, (for who without horrour can relate
<pb facs="tcp:58678:10"/>their Blaſphemies?) what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you offer of that kind, they evade; yet ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend highly to Reaſon, and intimate they would be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfyed, could they but meet with ſuch Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions might be neceſſarily concluſive to their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, and enforce their Aſſent: And certainly, the goodneſs, and Infinite Mercy of God, (ever le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible in all his dealings with Mankind,) doth moſt il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtriouſly
<pb facs="tcp:58678:11"/>diſplay it ſelf in this, That even when they not only (like deſperate Traytors) renounce all Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance to Him, but deny his very Eſſence, from whence they received their own: Yet ſtill he affords them Natures Light, and deprives them not of thoſe common Principles, which if ſeriouſly conſulted, are able to reduce them from their horrid Phrenſie, and evidently demonſtrate the
<pb facs="tcp:58678:11"/>Exiſtence of a Deity that Created the World, and continually Governs it by his Providence, and whom to acknowledge Love, and obey, is not only their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but their glory, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and chiefeſt Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
            <p>To make it appear that Nature of it ſelf doth ſo far enlighten, and conduct us, is our preſent deſign, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the more to comply with their Humour, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends

            <p>For ſince Infinite being is the immediate efficient cauſe of this World, and the ſeveral beings therein produced, <hi>Theorem</hi> 32. And that every efficient cauſe Acts for ſome end, eſpecially
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:58678:47"/>infinite being, becauſe it is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Wiſdom, <hi>Theorem</hi> the 9th. Therefore either Infinite being muſt be ſaid in vain to Act for ſome end, or it will order this World, and all the ſeveral be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings by fit and agreeable means to ſome end intended and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by its ſelf in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction; and this is properly called to rule by its providence, <hi>Definition</hi> the 10th.</p>
            <p>The ſame likewiſe appears otherwiſe thus, Since we mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly ſee there is a providence in all Animals; for Brutes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for their young; parents for their Children; A Prince
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:58678:47"/>for his Subjects, which finite providence muſt be from Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite being, <hi>Theorem</hi> 32.. And therefore Infinite being it ſelf muſt be provident, as well by our 8. as 3. <hi>Axiom;</hi> yea muſt be Infinite Providence; that is, a Providence extended to every finite being; for otherwiſe it would not be infinite: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this World and all things therein are governed by the providence of Infinite being.</p>
            <p>Again, every finite being is continually produced by Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite being, which is called the conſervation of ſuch finite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Theorem</hi> the 30th. But it
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:58678:48"/>is produced by an Act of its will, which is the ſame with Infinite Wiſdom, <hi>Theorem</hi> 29. And therefore neither raſhly nor to no purpoſe, but for ſome end, and therefore it is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually directed to ſuch end, by the ſame infinite being which indeed would not be infinite, if it were not provident, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if it were Infinite Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which leaves nothing any where wholly void of it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Now this Providence of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Being is found to diſcharge a threefold office.</p>

            <p>And moſt conſonant it was to Infinite Wiſdom, to will, that ſome of its Creatures ſhould be free Agents; that is, endued with underſtanding and will, to the end, that infinite being might not remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known

               <hi>wounding of Charity,</hi> and bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing <hi>peace</hi> and Brotherly love out of our ſtreets for a few <hi>dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingopinions,</hi> in themſelvs no leſs <hi>indifferent,</hi> than to us <hi>uncertain;</hi> and yet in the mean time ſeem not at all affected with their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable condition, who ſcarce ever heard of a <hi>Redeemer.</hi> Have we not the higheſt obligations in the World upon us, to be thankfull to that mercifull hand of <hi>Providence,</hi> that hath order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our lott ſo graciouſly, and fixt our Habitations in thoſe Regions where <hi>Christianity</hi> is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſally profeſt? And can we any way more <hi>illuſtriouſly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi>

'Twould certainly be more <hi>glorious,</hi> if theſe <hi>great and fervent Spirits</hi> would turn the bright flames of their <hi>Zeal</hi> to the burning down <hi>Ethnick Temples,</hi> rather than to the waſting and unſettling <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Churches,</hi> and ſtrive more to enlarge the Tents of <hi>them</hi> in the borders of <hi>Japhet,</hi> than to promote unſeaſonable diviſions in <hi>Reuben,</hi> which muſt coſt each truly pious Chriſtian ſo many <hi>ſad thoughts of heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="72" facs="tcp:58678:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>In the <hi>Primative days,</hi> The Promulgers of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> went out ſupernaturally furniſht with the <hi>gift of Tongues,</hi> and ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to ſeal the truth of their Doctrine as well with working of <hi>Miracles,</hi> as laying down their lives, and by performing <hi>ſuch Actions</hi> as could not but be acknowledged the Effects of a <hi>divine</hi> aſſiſtance, did (as it were) <hi>enforce</hi> the Gentiles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; But now thoſe extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <hi>Gifts</hi> being generally cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, there ſeems a greater need of improving <hi>natural parts</hi> to the beſt advantage, and purſuing the moſt <hi>rational method</hi> of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:58678:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>Inſtruction, which ſeems to be</p>
            <p>Firſt, To <hi>caſt out the ſtrong man armed,</hi> to ſhew the <hi>vanity</hi> of their preſent Apprehenſions, taking them off from their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping <hi>Idols</hi> or <hi>Devils,</hi> by ſhew-them, that it is no leſſe <hi>ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous</hi> then <hi>wicked and dereſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, To lead them by the moſt ſutable <hi>perſwaſives</hi> and demonſtrations to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>one true God, Creator and Governour of the whole World and all things therein;</hi> and that he is <hi>most good, most wiſe, most bleſſed, Eternal, Immutable,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:58678:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>And that if he were not al this, he would want to be <hi>ſo,</hi> and ſo could not be God; for who in his witts would admit an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent God</hi> into his <hi>Creed,</hi> ſince all <hi>want</hi> is Imperfection and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, After their minds are hereby ſettled in this great Principle, <hi>The Exiſtence of a Deity,</hi> they are next to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed concerning their <hi>own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> in what condition <hi>man</hi> was <hi>Originally created,</hi> and how he fell by Satans temptation from that glorious <hi>ſtate,</hi> which may eaſily be evinced; for ſince <hi>all other Creatures</hi> keep in the ſame
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:58678:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>natural order ordained for them from the beginning; how ſhall we imagine that <hi>mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> (the nobleſt part of the Creation, and for whoſe ſake the reſt ſeem chiefly made) ſhould ſo prodigiouſly be <hi>depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> and become worſe than brutiſh, raging in quarrels, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines and cruelties againſt it ſelf, and abnoxious to igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, inconſtancy, ſloth, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, death, and a thouſand miſeries which would accuſe infinite wiſdome of an errour, <hi>unleſſe</hi> we believe that man firſt created upright, and endued with <hi>Free will,</hi> did by tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:58678:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>forfeit</hi> all his happy pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, and ſo became liable to all theſe evills as <hi>juſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> for ſuch his ſin.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, hence it follows, that man having offended againſt an <hi>Infinite God,</hi> there was no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſing Divine Juſtice with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Infinite ſatisfaction; This only, the <hi>Son of God</hi> could make, whoſe love to miſerable <hi>humanity</hi> cauſes him to quit his <hi>manſions of Glory,</hi> to take on him our nature, and by his <hi>death</hi> to open to us the gates of <hi>Life and Immortality:</hi> and here may be <hi>unfolded</hi> the whole myſtery of our bleſſed Saviours <hi>Incarnation,</hi>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:58678:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>the purity of his <hi>life,</hi> grievouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his <hi>Crucifiction,</hi> certainty of his <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> and glorious <hi>Aſcention,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Adde to all this the Excellency of the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> ſhewing, that there is nothing required in the whole Chriſtian profeſſion, but what is highly <hi>reaſonable</hi> in it ſelf, and mainly <hi>conducive to the accompliſhing and ennobling</hi> humane nature: not a few <hi>rigid perſons</hi> are apt to draw our <hi>Religion</hi> (the greateſt <hi>beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> in the World) in too ſad a <hi>habit,</hi> with a <hi>frowning</hi> (<hi>counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance</hi> and <hi>ſower looks,</hi> more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to <hi>frighten</hi> than <hi>invite</hi> raw
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:58678:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Proſelites</hi> to a more intimate converſe.</p>
            <p>The perſons that undertake this <hi>glorious work</hi> of propagating the Goſpel (which is attended with the <hi>Plaudites</hi> of Angels and <hi>prayers</hi> of all good men) ought to be fitted for the ſame in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of <hi>miſſion</hi> and <hi>Abilites.</hi> 'Tis no ſleight nor trivial affair at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted out of <hi>wantonneſſe, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> or <hi>vain-glory;</hi> they are <hi>Gods Ambaſſadors,</hi> and ſhould ſee they have his <hi>Commiſſion</hi> and <hi>Warrant,</hi> without whom <hi>Paul plants, and</hi> Apollo <hi>waters, but all in vain.</hi> A lively vigorous faith is required to ſet forth the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:58678:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>Word with <hi>power and authority,</hi> and carry them through all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, hazards and difficulties that may occur; they ought alſo to be very expert in the <hi>language</hi> of thoſe perſons they deſign to inſtruct, that they may readily in <hi>clear intelligible terms</hi> diſtill their diſcourſes into their ſouls. Thus our <hi>bleſſed Lord,</hi> though he choſe his Apoſtles <hi>Fiſhermen, and ordinary Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks</hi> (leſt vain men ſhould ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect his holy Doctrine for the contrivement of ſome <hi>great worldly wits</hi> or plot of ſubtle ſelf-intereſted <hi>Politicians;</hi>) yet before he ſent them abroad
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:58678:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>into the Nations, he made them the beſt <hi>Linguiſts</hi> in the World; above all, <hi>ſweetneſſe of nature, and holyneſſe of Life</hi> are neceſſary. This is a <hi>Continual Sermon,</hi> and convinces more than all the charms of the moſt accompliſht <hi>Orator.</hi> How odious did <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teonſneſſe and cruelly</hi> render the very name of <hi>Christianity</hi> to the poor <hi>Americans, Shew us thy Faith by thy Works</hi> is every mans propſal. Can we imagine they deſign any other but to put a <hi>cheat</hi> on us, who tell, us of <hi>Growns, and Glory, and everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting happineſs</hi> in the other world which we can only aſpire to by
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:58678:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Purity and Mortification, Self-denial,</hi> &amp;c. in this; And yet themſelves practice things <hi>quite contrary</hi> to all theſe they ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly recommend.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Stumbling-blocks</hi> which cauſe <hi>the name of the Lord to be blaſphemed amongſt the Gentiles</hi> ought to be removed; And theſe <hi>Fiſhers of men</hi> muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove themſelves <hi>Lights</hi> in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation</hi> as well as <hi>Doctrine;</hi> That ſo God may be glorified, the ſouls of their hearers ſaved, and themſelves enjoy that <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious promiſe</hi> made to ſuch as turn many to Righteouſneſſe;
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:58678:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
